# Sorting-Visualizer-
This JavaScript project is an interactive sorting visualizer that lets users choose from six different sorting algorithms (including Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, and more). Users can customize the number of bars and control the sorting speed, watching the sorting process unfold in real-time through an intuitive graphical interface.
